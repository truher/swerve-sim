/**
 * A class that provides a source of pink noise with a power spectrum
 * density (PSD) proportional to 1/f^alpha. "Regular" pink noise has a
 * PSD proportional to 1/f, i.e. alpha=1. However, many natural
 * systems may require a different PSD proportionality. The value of
 * alpha may be from 0 to 2, inclusive. The special case alpha=0
 * results in white noise (directly generated random numbers) and
 * alpha=2 results in brown noise (integrated white noise).
 * <p>
 * The values are computed by applying an IIR filter to generated
 * Gaussian random numbers. The number of poles used in the filter
 * may be specified. For each number of poles there is a limiting
 * frequency below which the PSD becomes constant. Values as low as
 * 1-3 poles produce relatively good results, however these values
 * will be concentrated near zero. Using a larger number of poles
 * will allow more low frequency components to be included, leading to
 * more variation from zero. However, the sequence is stationary,
 * that is, it will always return to zero even with a large number of
 * poles.
 * <p>
 * The distribution of values is very close to Gaussian with mean
 * zero, but the variance depends on the number of poles used. The
 * algorithm can be made faster by changing the method call
 * <code> rnd.nextGaussian() </code> to
 * <code> rnd.nextDouble()-0.5 </code>
 * in the method {@link #nextValue()}. The resulting distribution is
 * almost Gaussian, but has a relatively larger amount of large
 * values.
 * <p>
 * The IIR filter used by this class is presented by N. Jeremy Kasdin,
 * Proceedings of the IEEE, Vol. 83, No. 5, May 1995, p. 822.
